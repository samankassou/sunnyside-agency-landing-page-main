## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

CSS Grid position is the more important thing that I have learned in this challenge. I discovered how to load images base on the screen size and finally I know how to make some shapes in CSS like triangle, stars etc.

Change the color of a SVG loaded with `img` tag.

### Continued development

I will learn how to structure SASS files for big projects, explore BEM for best CSS class names.
